# Helia-API2
I promise you this one is useful well at least for me 


This time I have a real problem at hand.


# Problem statement

For the past year I have been programming on linux mostly barely touched my windows machine, so one day I was exploring some packages because I couldn't find them on apt and decided it was time to try to manually install them, I did it before and nothing broke, but this time my machine broke, it could be due to manual install or ubuntu security patch, it didn't brake totally but the GUI was gone I had just the terminal.

I could only run one server at the time the terminal was overtaken everytime.
So I want an API with helia to store my files and I will retrieve them on my windows machine before doing a fresh install, yea I tried going through the broken packages, no there is no easy fix.
